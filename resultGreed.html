<h1>You Have Been Placed in the Fourth Circle of Hell, with the Greedy</h1>

<h3>Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many, <br>
  On one side and the other, with great howls, <br>
  Rolling weights forward by main force of chest. <br>

They clashed together, and then at that point<br>
  Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,<br>
  Crying, "Why keepest?" and, "Why squanderest thou?"

<h3>Dante took all of these into consideration when deciding your placement in his epic poem and made a psuedo-random decision based on how many times each different sin was committed. Good luck toiling away for the rest of eternity with no chance of escape or progression.</h3>
