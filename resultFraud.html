<h1>You Have Been Placed in the Eigth Circle of Hell, with the Fraudulant</h1>

<h3>Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven, <br>
  Injury is the end; and all such end <br> 
  Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.<br>

But because fraud is man's peculiar vice,<br>
  More it displeases God; and so stand lowest<br>
  The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.</h3>

<h3>Dante took all of these into consideration when deciding your placement in his epic poem and made a psuedo-random decision based on how many times each different sin was committed. Good luck toiling away for the rest of eternity with no chance of escape or progression.</h3>
