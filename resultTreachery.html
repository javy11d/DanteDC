<h1>You Have Been Placed in the Ninth Circle of Hell, with the Treacherous</h1>

<h3>His mouth uplifted from his grim repast, <br>
  That sinner, wiping it upon the hair<br>
  Of the same head that he behind had wasted.<br>

Then he began: "Thou wilt that I renew<br>
  The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already<br>
  To think of only, ere I speak of it;<br>

But if my words be seed that may bear fruit<br>
  Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,<br>
  Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.

<h3>Dante took all of these into consideration when deciding your placement in his epic poem and made a psuedo-random decision based on how many times each different sin was committed. Good luck toiling away for the rest of eternity with no chance of escape or progression.</h3>
