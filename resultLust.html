<h3>[Francesca]: "One day, to pass the time away, we read
of Lancelot – how love had overcome him.
We were alone, and we suspected nothing.
And time and time again that reading led
our eyes to meet, and made our faces pale,
and yet one point alone defeated us.
When we had read how the desired smile
was kissed by one who was so true a lover,
this one, who never shall be parted from me,
while all his body trembled, kissed my mouth.
A Gallehault indeed, that book and he
who wrote it, too; that day we read no more." (Inf. V, 127-138)</h3>

<h2>Dante took all of these into consideration when deciding your placement in his epic poem and made a psuedo-random decision based on how many times each different sin was committed. Good luck toiling away for the rest of eternity with no chance of escape or progression.</h2>
