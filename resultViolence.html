<h1>You Have Been Placed in the Seventh Circle of Hell, with the Violent</h1>

<h3>But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near <br>
  The river of blood, within which boiling is <br>
  Whoe'er by violence doth injure others." <br>

O blind cupidity, O wrath insane, <br>
  That spurs us onward so in our short life, <br>
  And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!</h3>

<h3>Dante took all of these into consideration when deciding your placement in his epic poem and made a psuedo-random decision based on how many times each different sin was committed. Good luck toiling away for the rest of eternity with no chance of escape or progression.</h3>
